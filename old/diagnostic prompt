I need you to write an exhaustive step-by-step guide to GLM model evaluation using the `scikit-learn` package, for a GLM model that is either Poisson or Gamma, and is used to estimate aggregate incremental paid losses for a book of business. 

Throughout this prompt, I use [*< >*] as a delimiter to indicate that you should replace the text between the delimiters with your own text. For example, if I write [*<some condition is met>*], then you should replace [*<some condition is met>*] with your own text describing the condition that must be met for the plot to be useful.

The guide should include the following:

1. A high-level overview of what your guide is about, why it is useful, how the sections of the guide are organized, and how each section will be structured, also make a note that the guide is for a Poisson or Gamma GLM model.
   1. Also note that the guide is intended to be an exhaustive reference for GLM model evaluation, but that it is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction to GLM modelling.
2. A very short intro and description of the types of diagnostics, plots and scores that are used to evaluate GLM models.
3. Assume that the data has already been pre-processed, and that the GLM model has already been fit to the data. The guide should focus on the evaluation of the model, and not on the pre-processing or model fitting.
   1. data are already in a dataframe `df`
   2. X is a dataframe containing the features, and y is a series containing the target
   3. A Poisson GLM `poisson` and a Gamma GLM `gamma`  have already been fit to the data using `sklearn.linear_model.PoissonRegressor` or `sklearn.linear_model.GammaRegressor`, respectively, and stored in their respective variables.
4. The bulk of your guide should consist of an organized list of steps, grouped into a logical hierarchical structure, with each step describing:
   1. How to implement a single diagnostic, plot or score,
   2. The code to implement the diagnostic, plot or score, and
   3. A short discussion of the purpose, interpretation, and limitations of the particular diagnostic, plot or score.

At minimum, your guide should include the following diagnostics, plots and scores:
1. standardized Pearson residuals vs. fitted values, accident period, development period, and/or calendar period
2. deviance residuals vs. fitted values, accident period, development period, and/or calendar period
3. qq plots
4. pp plots
5. histogram of standardized residuals
6. RMSE
7. MAE
8. AIC/BIC/other information criteria
9. discuss cross validation for loss reserve triangles and how to implement it keeping the triangle structure intact
10. <add any other diagnostics, plots or scores that you think are useful right here> [*<additional diagnostic>*]
11. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
12. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
13. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
14. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
15. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
16. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
17. [*< additional diagnostic >*]
    1.  do not stick to the most common diagnostics, plots and scores, but also include some less common ones that you think are useful

Each section in your guide describing a single diagnostic, plot or score should be structured similarly to this example:
<this is an example -- please change the actual text as appropriate>
"""
1. Standardized Pearson Residuals vs. Fitted Values
    - **Purpose**: To check for the presence of outliers, underdispersion or overdispersion in the model.
    - **Implementation**:
  
        ```
            <this should be formated correctly as python code>
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

            pp = StandardScaler().fit_transform(poisson._offset_exposure(X))
            y_pred = poisson.predict(X)
            sr = (poisson._link.inv(y) - poisson._link.inv(y_pred))/np.sqrt(poisson._variance(y_pred))
            plt.scatter(y_pred, sr, alpha=0.1)
            plt.xlabel('Fitted Values')
            plt.ylabel('Standardized Pearson Residuals')
            plt.show()
        ```

    - **Discussion**: Standardized Pearson residuals should be roughly normally distributed around 0, with no obvious patterns or trends. Outliers in the residuals may indicate a problem with the model, such as the presence of influential observations. Underdispersion or overdispersion may also be detected by this plot.
    - **Analysis**: 
      - If the plot is roughly normally distributed around 0, then there are no obvious problems with the model.
      - The following may indicate a problem with the model:
        - outliers in the residuals
        - residuals that are not normally distributed
      - If there are outliers in the residuals, then the model may be overfitting the data, or there may be influential observations.
         - To diagnose the underlying problem:
           1. Check the residuals for influential observations, and remove them if necessary.
           2. If the residuals are still not normally distributed, then the model may be overfitting the data. In this case, try to reduce the number of features, or use regularization to reduce the model complexity.
      - If the residuals are not normally distributed, then the model may be underdispersed or overdispersed.
        - To diagnose the underlying problem:
          1. [*<steps to take>*]
      - [*<any other possible problems that may be detected by this plot, along with steps to diagnose the problem, if possible>*]
    - **Limitations**: 
      - This plot may not be useful if [*<some condition is met>*].

Write your guide to be used by experienced property casualty actuaries, who have lots of experience working with data and statistics in general, but may not have much GLM modelling experience. Describe the process in a logical step-by-step manner, and include code snippets that can be copy-pasted into a Jupyter notebook. The guide should be written in a way that is easy to follow, and that can be used as a reference for future projects.

Keep in mind that [*< >*] is a delimiter that you should replace with your own text. For example, if I write [*<some condition is met>*], then you should replace [*<some condition is met>*] with your own text describing the condition that must be met for the plot to be useful.

This is a good starting point for the first section:
"""
1. Introduction
This guide is an exhaustive reference for evaluating Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) using the scikit-learn package, specifically for Poisson or Gamma GLM models used to estimate aggregate incremental paid losses for a book of business. It assumes that the data has already been pre-processed, and that the Poisson or Gamma GLM model has already been fit to the data using sklearn.linear_model.PoissonRegressor or sklearn.linear_model.GammaRegressor, respectively, and stored in their respective variables. The guide is intended to provide a step-by-step process for evaluating the fitted models using various diagnostics, plots and scores, and it assumes that the reader has some experience with data and statistics.

The guide is organized as follows:

Section 2 provides a short introduction to the types of diagnostics, plots and scores that are commonly used to evaluate GLM models.
Section 3 describes the structure of the data and the fitted models, and explains how to import the required packages.
Section 4 provides an organized list of steps for evaluating GLM models, grouped into a logical hierarchical structure. Each step describes how to implement a single diagnostic, plot or score, provides the code to implement it, and includes a short discussion of the purpose, interpretation, and limitations of the particular diagnostic, plot or score.
